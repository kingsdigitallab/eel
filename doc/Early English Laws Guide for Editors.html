<p>In order to obtain a correct output of your edition, <strong>it is strongly advised to follow the instructions below in the right order</strong>: <img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" src="Early%20English%20Laws%20Guide%20for%20Editors_files/14221431.png" data-image-src="attachments/14058919/14221431.png"></p>


<h3 id="GuideforEditors-Reviewthemetadataoftheeditionrecord:">Review the metadata of the edition record:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>leave the "Abbreviation" and "Version" fields untouched</li>
	<li>add a date for your edition in the "Date of edition" field following the suggestions given just below the date field.</li>
	<li>add any eventual hyper-archetypes in the bottom section of the 
page. You will need to use only Greek letters for the hyper-archetypes. 
Give a brief description for each, as per example below. Remember to 
"save" or "save and add another" in the bottom right corner of the page 
whenever you add something.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> <img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" src="Early%20English%20Laws%20Guide%20for%20Editors_files/14221433.png" data-image-src="attachments/14058919/14221433.png"><br>
<strong>Edit the text of the edition</strong></p>


<p>It is a good idea to familiarise yourself with the editing page 
before you start adding text to any field. The editing page is made of 
several components:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the <strong>text      editor</strong> itself: in the middle of the page;</li>
	<li>the <strong>text      structure</strong>: on the left hand side;</li>
	<li>the <strong>commentary      editor</strong>: under the text editor. <img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" src="Early%20English%20Laws%20Guide%20for%20Editors_files/14221435.png" data-image-src="attachments/14058919/14221435.png"><br>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>It is very important that the next steps are done in the following order:</p>
<ol>
	<li>&nbsp;
	<ol>
		<li>write       or paste the plain text of your edition (without commentary, notes or       critical apparatus)</li>
		<li>mark-up       the structure of your text (please see below for more details on how to       do this)</li>
		<li>mark-up       inline elements (additions, deletions, gaps...)</li>
		<li>insert       page or folio breaks</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Add the      critical apparatus</li>
	<li>Add the      commentary
	<ol>
		<li>attach       commentaries to specific units of your text (more on this below)</li>
		<li>format       your commentary</li>
		<li>mark up       references to other texts</li>
		<li>mark up       people, places, glossary terms and bibliographic references</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Remove      editorial notes from the text</li>
</ol>




<h2 id="GuideforEditors-HowdoIusetheeditingpage?">How do I use the editing page?</h2>

<p>The text and commentary editors have toolbars at the top with buttons to mark-up highlighted text. <img class="confluence-embedded-image confluence-content-image-border" src="Early%20English%20Laws%20Guide%20for%20Editors_files/14221437.png" data-image-src="attachments/14058919/14221437.png"></p>

<h2 id="GuideforEditors-HowdoImark-upthestructureofmytext?">How do I mark-up the structure of my text?</h2>

<p>The text editor offers several options for the marking-up of the text structure:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Code</strong> (used to wrap a single code or single items in      collections of codes, e.g. Quadripartitus)</li>
	<li><strong>Book</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Prologue</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Chapter</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Division</strong>: a subdivision of a chapter or a prologue. For      instance Chapter 4.2 would be the second division within a chapter.</li>
</ul>


<p>It is important is understand that the above structural units form a 
hierarchy and some combination are obviously inconsistent (e.g. a book 
within a chapter or a prologue within a division). Although the text 
editor let you mark up your text in many ways (including possibly 
inconsistent ways), it is advised to follow a top-down approach: 
starting with the code, the books then the chapters and prologues and 
finally with the divisions.</p>

<p>To mark-up a section of your text as any of the above structures:</p>
<ol>
	<li>select the portion of text you are interested in (to select the    
  whole text it is sometimes easier to use the shortcut combination 
ctrl+A,      or cmd+A for mac)</li>
	<li>Click on the relevant option to add structure to the text</li>
</ol>


<p>The structure is summarized in the left hand box, mouse over the box to update the structure display.</p>


<h2 id="GuideforEditors-Howisthetextstructurenumbered?">How is the text structure numbered?</h2>

<p>Sequential numbers are automatically assigned to each structural unit
 of your text. Those numbers are visible in the text structure panel on 
the left hand side of your screen. All those numbers are relative to the
 containing unit. So the second division of any chapter will received 
the number 2. However the system knows which chapter they belong to and 
is therefore able to distinguish them when they will be rendered on the 
website.</p>

<p>As you'll notice, those numbers are not visible in the text editor 
itself. For this reason you may find it useful to temporarily keep 
explicitly written numbers within your text (e.g. '[Prol. 1]' for the 
first prologue or [2.3] for subdivision 2 of chapter 3). At the end of 
the editing process those numbers should be removed, as they will be 
redundant with the information already captured by the system.</p>

<p>If the number assigned automatically by the system is incorrect, you 
can overwrite it by clicking on the corresponding digits in the left 
hand side panel. A small window will pop up and ask you to correct the 
number.</p>

<p>If your edition also feature translations or transcriptions, care 
should be taken to ensure that all texts share precisely the same 
structure and numbering otherwise the their synchronised rendering on 
the website will contain discrepancies. The preview page is there to 
help you detect such problems, you can find a link to it in the top 
right corner of the editor.</p>


<h2 id="GuideforEditors-HowdoIremovethemarkup?">How do I remove the mark up?</h2>

<p>The right way to remove the mark up is to first place your cursor 
anywhere on the marked-up text then click the eraser button ('Clear').</p>

<p><strong>It is better to avoid deleting the mark-up by deleting the text</strong>
 (e.g. with the delete or backspace keys). Doing this could break the 
structure of your text or leave invisible and polluting mark-up in your 
text.</p>


<h2 id="GuideforEditors-HowdoIsavemychangestothedatabase?">How do I save my changes to the database?</h2>

<p>Your changes to the text are saved to the database when:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You click on the "save" button at the top of the editor. In      
principle you only need to click this button before leaving the web page
      (or closing the browser/computer) or at the end of an editing 
session.</li>
	<li>You move your mouse over the text structure. That way your text is 
     automatically saved each time you navigate from one portion of your
 text      to another by clicking on the relevant division in the 
structure.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="GuideforEditors-Inlineelements">Inline elements</h3>

<p>Inline mark-up refers to the explicit labelling of a sequence of 
characters or words within a paragraph. This type of mark-up allows you 
to preserve additional characteristics of your text in a way that is 
both standard and easily understood and processed by computers. Apart 
from the 'Gap' mark-up, all the inline elements are edited in the same 
way: you first highlight the relevant sequence of characters or words 
with your mouse then you click on the button which correspond to your 
mark up. With the 'Gap' element you don't need to highlight anything, 
you just have to place your cursor at the exact place where the gap 
occurs in the text.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Title</strong>: the title of a law code, of a book or any other unit of text.</li>
	<li><strong>Rubric</strong>: 'contains the text of any rubric or 
heading attached to a particular manuscript item, that is, a string of 
words through which a manuscript signals the beginning of a text 
division, often with an assertion as to its author and title, which is 
in some way set off from the text itself, usually in red ink, or by use 
of different size or type of script, or some other such visual device'.</li>
	<li><strong>Added</strong>: 'contains letters, words, or phrases inserted in the text by an author, scribe, annotator, or corrector'.</li>
	<li><strong>Deleted</strong>: 'contains a letter, word, or passage 
deleted, marked as deleted, or otherwise indicated as superfluous or 
spurious in the copy text by an author, scribe, annotator, or 
corrector'.</li>
	<li><strong>Gap</strong>: 'indicates a point where material has been 
omitted in a transcription, whether for editorial reasons described in 
the TEI header, as part of sampling practice, or because the material is
 illegible, invisible, or inaudible'.</li>
	<li><strong>Supplied</strong>: 'signifies text supplied by the editor 
for any reason, typically because the original cannot be read because of
 physical damage or loss to the original'.</li>
</ul>


<p>To unmark an element, simply place your cursor within it and press the 'clear' button.</p>


<h3 id="GuideforEditors-People,places,glossarytermsandbibliographicreferences">People, places, glossary terms and bibliographic references</h3>


<h2 id="GuideforEditors-HowdoImarkupaperson,aplace,aglossarytermorareferencetoabibliographicentry?">How do I mark up a person, a place, a glossary term or a reference to a bibliographic entry?</h2>

<p>Follow these steps to mark-up a person in your text:</p>
<ol>
	<li>highlight the name of the person in your text.</li>
	<li>select the option 'person' in the drop down in the toolbar (at the      top of the text editor).</li>
	<li>type the name of the person in the little text box on the right of      the dropdown and and press ENTER.</li>
	<li>if the person is found in the database, it should be included in      list under the text box.
	<ol>
		<li>If it is not found, no list will appear. It is either because the 
      spelling of the name you have typed does not match the one in the 
      database or simply because the name is not in the database.</li>
		<li>Note that you can enter fragments of the entry you are looking 
for.       For instance 'wil' will match 'William I'. This is 
particularly useful       for bibliographic entries as it allows you to 
search for an entry based       on any of its fields (title, year, 
authors).</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>click on the relevant entry in that list</li>
	<li>the highlighted name in your text should now be marked up in blue</li>
</ol>


<p>The procedure is the same for places, glossary terms and bibliographic references.</p>

<p>To unmark an element, simply place your cursor within it and press the 'clear' button.</p>


<h3 id="GuideforEditors-Pageandfoliobreaks">Page and folio breaks</h3>

<p>The page break button in the toolbar can be used to specify that the 
current location of the cursor in your text correspond to the beginning 
of a new folio side. By specifying the folio break for each witness the 
website will have enough information to display the correct folio 
facsimile next to a particular section of your text.</p>

<p>To review or modify the information about a page break, simply place 
your cursor anywhere within '[PB]' and click the 'Page break' button 
again. A window will pop up with a form to correct the manuscript and 
the folio or page number.</p>

<p>To unmark a page break, simply place your cursor within it and press the 'clear' button.</p>


<h3 id="GuideforEditors-Criticalapparatus">Critical apparatus</h3>



<h2 id="GuideforEditors-Howtoeditthecriticalapparatus?">How to edit the critical apparatus?</h2>


<h4 id="GuideforEditors-Toaddthecriticalapparatus:">To add the critical apparatus:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>select the relevant portion of text in the text editor</li>
	<li>click the Critical Apparatus icon ('A <sup>1</sup> ')</li>
	<li>a window pops up:
	<ul>
		<li>the 'lemma' field correspond to the text you have selected</li>
		<li>each row under that field correspond to different readings:
		<ul>
			<li>write the alternative reading in the text box (anything surrounded with {} will appear in italic on the website; e.g. 
<div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">
<pre class="theme: Confluence; brush: xml; gutter: false" style="font-size:12px;"> {om} locus</pre>
</div></div>
  will        result into '<em>om</em>. locus' ).</li>
			<li>then, on the same row, tick the checkboxes under the witnesses or hyperarchetypes which contain that reading.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>the rows left empty will be ignored by the system</li>
		<li>select 'insert' (or cancel to discard the changes)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>now you should see '[A]' at the end of your selection. This serves as reference to the apparatus you have just created.</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="GuideforEditors-Tovieworeditacriticalapparatus:">To view or edit a critical apparatus:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>locate the apparatus in your text</li>
	<li>click on the green [A] in the text and make sure your cursor is blinking within the '[A]'.</li>
	<li>then click the Critical Apparatus button ('A <sup>1</sup> ')</li>
	<li>now a window will pop up and display your readings
	<ul>
		<li>edit the lemma, readings or checkboxes</li>
		<li>click 'insert' (or cancel to discard the changes)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="GuideforEditors-Todeleteacriticalapparatus:">To delete a critical apparatus:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>locate the apparatus in your text</li>
	<li>click on the [A] and make sure your cursor is blinking within the '[A]'.</li>
	<li>click the eraser button ('Clear').</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="GuideforEditors-Commentary">Commentary</h3>



<h2 id="GuideforEditors-Howdoesthecommentarywork?">How does the commentary work?</h2>

<p>A commentary text box is visible under the main text editor on the 
editing page. Note that the structure of the commentary closely follows 
that of the edition. The commentary is broken into smaller parts, each 
one attached to a particular division of your edition (book, chapter, 
sub-division, etc.).</p>

<p>To comment on a particular section of your text, simply click on that
 division in the text structure (on the left hand side on your screen). 
This will display the corresponding portion of the edition in the main 
text editor and the corresponding commentary in the box below it where 
it can be edited.</p>

<p>To remove a commentary, just remove all the commentary text.</p>

<p>The commentary is always saved together with the text of the edition.</p>

<p>Each time your edition is saved, the text structure is refreshed and 
division of the text containing a commentary will appear there with a 
small document icon next to them.</p>


<h2 id="GuideforEditors-HowcanIexplicitlydeclareareferencetoanothertext?">How can I explicitly declare a reference to another text?</h2>

<p>If your commentary mentions other text which are also part of this 
project, it is worth marking up those references so they will be 
clickable on the website.</p>

<p>Here's how to turn the description of a reference into a hyperlink:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Highlight the description of your reference with your mouse</li>
	<li>Click on the button called 'Reference to another text'</li>
	<li>A new window pops-up to let you enter additional information about      the text
	<ul>
		<li>Type of text let you choose between an edition or a witness and       between a transcription or a translation</li>
		<li>Once the type of text selected, you can choose the actual witness       or edition in the 'Text' drop-down</li>
		<li>If your reference relates to a portion of law code borrowed from  
     another text, you can select 'quotation'. Otherwise set this 
drop-down to       'other'.</li>
		<li>The rest of the form let you specify which portion of the text    
   you'd like to reference. This is optional but it is recommended to be
 as       specific as possible as the hyperlink will point exactly to 
that area.
		<ul>
			<li>The portion of the text can be defined in one of two ways:
			<ul>
				<li>it is either a single unit of text (for instance a whole chapter
         or a sub-chapter). A row will appear at the bottom of the form 
where         you can specify the position of the unit.</li>
				<li>or it is a range comprised between two units of text (for       
  instance between the second chapter to the first sub-division of the  
       fourth chapter). Two rows will appear at the bottom of the form 
where         you can specify the position of the beginning and the end 
of the range.         Both are inclusive.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Note that, depending on the structure of the referenced text and 
       the granularity of the selected units of text, some fields can be
 left        unspecified.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click 'Insert' to confirm the information associated to the      reference</li>
</ul>


<p>To view or modify the information associated with a reference, simply
 click anywhere in its description (this description is underlined in 
blue) and then click on the 'Reference' button again. The same window 
will pop up.</p>
